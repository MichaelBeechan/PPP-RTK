# CLASLIB (CLAS test library)   
# ------------------------------

# Overview
CLAS test library is a reference implementation of CLAS, and it contains
conversion utilities or a post-processing PPP-RTK positioning utility depending
on its version. Please note it doesn't assure anything in terms of its 
effectiveness or reliability.

CLAS is the Centimeter-Level Augmentation Service of QZSS.
The service is provided as CLAS messages (Ref. Note 1), the format is
defined in RTCM STANDARD 10403.2(MT4073) and called 'Compact SSR'(Ref. Note 2).

The library is derived from RTKLIB (version 2.4.2p13, Ref. Note 3) and
GSILIB (version.1.0.3, Ref. Note 4).

# Contents of the Library
## CLASLIB Version 0.4.0 and later
The version 0.4.0 and later contains SSR2OSR, which is a Compact SSR to
OSR converter. It also includes a manual and a sample data set. The utilities
DUMPCSSR and QZS2RTCM included in version 0.3.1 are no longer supported from
this version.

The following files are used to decode Compact SSR.
  - cssr.c: functions to decode Compact SSR messages
  - cssr.h: header file for Compact SSR related functions
  - cssr2osr.c: functions for SSR to OSR conversion
  - grid.c: functions to handle the gridded correction

## CLASLIB Version 0.6.0 and later
The version 0.6.0 and later contains SSR2OBS, which is a Compact SSR to
virtual observations converter for the VRS-RTK positioning mode of RNX2RTKP.

## CLASLIB Version 0.7.0 and later
The version 0.7.0 and later supports Compact SSR SubType12 messages 
introduced from IS-QZSS-L6-002.

## CLASLIB Version 0.4.0-P, 0.4.0-PS and later
The version 0.4.0-P and later contains binary executable of RNX2RTKP, which
is a post-processing PPP-RTK positioning utility using compact SSR.
It also includes a manual and a sample data set. The utilities DUMPCSSR and
QZS2RTCM included in version 0.3.1 are no longer supported from this version.

The version 0.4.0-PS and later contains binary executable of RNX2RTKP and
its source code as well. Anything else is the same as version 0.4.0-P.

## CLASLIB Version 0.6.0-P, 0.6.0-PS and later
The version 0.6.0-P and later supports a VRS-RTK positioning mode in RNX2RTKP

It is required to submit an application form to get its source code and/or its
executable. For information on how to submit the application, please refer
to the following WEB page or contact the following e-mail address:

 URL : https://sys.qzss.go.jp/dod/en/downloads/clas.html
 e-mail : IS.PS-QZSS-L6@rm.MitsubishiElectric.co.jp


# Usage:
## SSR2OSR (for version 0.4.0 and later)
To make the executable, move to the folder 'util/ssr2osr' and use 'make' as
follows in a CYGWIN shell.
    > make

To make corrections represented in observation space from sample data,
    > make test1

## SSR2OSR (for version 0.6.1 and later)
To parse l6 message data into each compact ssr sub type message,
    > make test1d
    
In the above command, the option '-dump' is specified.
When this option is specified, only parse process is performed. No other process is performed.

## SSR2OSR (for version 0.7.0 and later)

To make corrections represented in observation space from sample data corresponding to IS-QZSS-L6-002 (including SubType12),
    > make test1_ST12
    
Please refer to the CLASLIB manual for more information.

## SSR2OBS (for version 0.6.0 and later)
To make the executable, move to the folder 'util/ssr2obs' and use 'make' as
follows in a CYGWIN shell.
    > make

To make virtual observations in RINEX3 format from sample data,
    > make test1r

To make virtual observations in RTCM3 MSM format from sample data,
    > make test1m

## SSR2OBS (for version 0.6.1 and later)
To parse l6 message data into each compact ssr sub type message,
    > make test1d

In the above command, the option '-dump' is specified.
When this option is specified, only parse process is performed. No other process is performed.


## SSR2OBS (for version 0.7.0 and later) 
To make virtual observations in RINEX3 format from sample data corresponding IS-QZSS-L6-002 (including SubType12),
    > make test1r_ST12
    
Please refer to the CLASLIB manual for more information.


# System Requirement:
The executable binaries included in this package require Microsoft Windows 7
64bit system (Ref. Note 5). To compile the CLAS test library, MinGW(Win32) or
CYGWIN is recommended. Other operation systems and compilers can be used with
this library but NOT guaranteed.
